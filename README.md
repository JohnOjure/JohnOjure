# 👋 Hi, I'm Oluwasetemi John Kunle-Ajayi

I'm a **student, researcher, and developer** focused on building and studying **intelligent systems that scale**.

My work sits at the intersection of **AI/ML research, backend engineering, and Web3**, with a strong emphasis on **reasoning, system design, and real-world impact**.

I care deeply about *why systems work*, not just *that they work*.
